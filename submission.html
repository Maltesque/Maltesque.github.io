                    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
                    <p style="color: black">The aim of the workshop is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss new ideas, trends and results concerning the application of ML methods to software quality evaluation. We expect that the workshop will help in: (i) the validation of existing ML methods for software quality evaluation as well as their application to novel contexts, (ii) the comparison of efficiency and effectiveness of ML methods, both among other automated approaches and the human judgement, and (iii) the adaptation of ML approaches already used in other areas of science in the context of software quality.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
                    <br>
  - Application of machine-learning in software quality evaluation,
  <br>
  - Analysis of multi-source data, 
  <br>
  - Knowledge acquisition from software repositories,
  <br>
  - Adoption and validation of machine learning models and algorithms in software quality,
  <br>
  - Decision support and analysis in software quality,
  <br>
  - Prediction models to support software quality evaluation</p>

<h3>Evaluation Criteria and Submission</h3>

<p style="color: black">We are looking for original research (even at early stages of evaluation) on how machine learning techniques can be applied into software quality evaluation problems. The maximum length of workshop papers is 6 pages (including references), and they will be part of the SANER 2018 proceedings and available by participants in advance through a workshop webpage. All papers should be submitted in PDF format (conforming to the IEEE conferences template) through 
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=maltesque2018" target="blank"><span class="label">EasyChair</span></a>
<br>
<br>
<b style="color: black">Important note: the process for paper submission and evaluation will be similar to SANER. Therefore, all submitted papers will undergo a rigorous peer review process, with emphasis on their originality, quality, soundness and relevance. Like SANER, the workshop will follow a double-blind review process, where three PC members will review the submitted papers. </b>
<br>
<br>
The workshop will follow a one-day format, consisting of 3 to 4 sessions. The workshop is intended to be highly interactive: for this reason, each accepted paper will have a maximum of 15/20 minutes for presentation, followed by 10/15 minutes for questions and discussion. We hope that the workshop will foster and promote collaboration, and there will be time set aside to support this. We also plan to support a wide dissemination of the accepted contributions as well as the participants discussion through Facebook and Twitter.
